# PRD: One Theme

## 📋 Executive Summary
Theme One is the primary "Super Mucca" interface for the PTVX system. It provides a modern, high-contrast, and highly accessible user interface built on top of Filament's styling engine. Its mission is to ensure that the complex HR data of the Italian Public Administration is presented clearly and efficiently.

## 👥 Target Personas

- **Power Users (HR Administrators)**: Need high-density layouts for batch data management.

## 🎨 Design Tokens
- **Primary Color**: `#7B2D8E` (PTV Purple) - Successive shades handled via HSL.
- **Backgrounds**: HSL-tailored dark mode and "Glassmorphism" for overlays.
- **Typography**: Google Fonts: **Inter** for UI, **Outfit** for headings.

- **Transitions**: Smooth 200ms ease-in-out for all interactive elements.

## ♿ Accessibility Patterns
